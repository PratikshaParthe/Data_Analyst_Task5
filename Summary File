Task: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python.
Objective: Extract meaningful insights using visual and statistical exploration.
Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Deliverables: Jupyter Notebook + PDF report

Key Steps Performed:

Data Loading & Cleaning:

Loaded Titanic dataset.

Checked data types, missing values, and filled or dropped missing data.

Descriptive Statistics:

Used .describe(), .info(), .value_counts() for overview.

Visual Exploration:

Pairplots, heatmaps, histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots using Seaborn.

Identified relationships between survival and features such as age, fare, class, and gender.

Observations:

Women and children had higher survival rates.

Passengers in higher classes survived more often.

Higher fare correlated with increased survival.

Final Findings:

Social status (class and fare) strongly influenced survival.

Gender and age were major factors in survival probability.

Outcome:
Improved ability to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies using EDA techniques.
