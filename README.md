# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns affecting passenger survival using Python.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- Key columns: `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`

## Tools
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Steps
1. Loaded and cleaned dataset (handled missing values).
2. Explored data using `.describe()`, `.info()`, and visualizations.
3. Plotted histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, and pairplots.
4. Summarized key insights.

## Key Insights
- Women and children had higher survival rates.  
- First-class passengers survived more often than third-class.  
- Higher fares were linked to increased survival probability.

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with full EDA  
- PDF Report with summarized findings
